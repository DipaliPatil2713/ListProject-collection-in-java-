A fail-fast iterator quickly throws an exception if you try to modify the collection while you're iterating through it.
This is to alert you to any changes, which helps in preventing bugs. It acts strictly, stopping the iteration as soon as it detects a modification.

On the other hand, a fail-safe iterator allows you to modify the collection while you're iterating through it without throwing an exception.
It works on a cloned copy of the collection, so changes don't affect the iteration process.
This is more lenient and is useful in environments where multiple threads might be modifying the collection simultaneously.

To avoid dealing with fail-fast iterators, you can use classes like CopyOnWriteArrayList and ConcurrentHashMap. 
These classes use fail-safe iterators, allowing you to modify the collection while iterating without throwing an exception.
They are particularly useful in multi-threaded environments where you expect concurrent modifications.
